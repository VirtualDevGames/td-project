Bug: check explosion effect looping one frame after ending

TODO: pop-up UI with turrets in inventory
- Can use currently set inventory just slide it in and out
- Turrets drag and drop

TODO 2: New towers
- Populate the project with new towers
- All towers have traits
- Start thinking about a rarity / cost system while working on them
- Think of tiers of them: common (weak), uncommon (less weak), rare (strong), epic (very strong) # names of tiers change for originality probably

Towers idea: every tower shoots normal for a while, then when max mana (think tft) they shoot or create a strong effect that sets them apart
from each other
(Watch for scope creep)
(Only create a few of these at first please, focus on getting a playable demo out first)

TODO 2.1: Traits system
- Update traits when towers are placed
- Check for traits of current towers placed (of course)
- Find a way to organize the towers under one node for easier searching

TODO 3: shop system
- Make a shop UI
- Set random towers to pop up every time shop is opened
- Give player debugged gold and subtract gold when item purchased
- Purchased item removed from shop and sent to player inventory

TODO 4: Augment and item system
- Pick one to do first
- Don't worry about balancing, just make sure effects work for now
