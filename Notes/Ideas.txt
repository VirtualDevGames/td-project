Idea #1 :
- Normal tower defense
- Towers have unique projectiles and "abilities" 
- Towers can be upgraded

Idea #2 :
- Several types of upgrades can be given to towers      10/10
- Acquiring towers:
	- Are there more than one type of tower?
		- Can be bought whenever (classic)   4/10
		- Bought at shop end of round        4/10
	- One type of tower?
		- Will each tower cost the same?
		- Will each consequent tower cost more? <^ TBD in balance
	- Towers are rare and can only be acquired through certain events 10000/10
		- Breaking down augments to craft towers
		- Augments that give towers
- Towers mechanic:
	- One type of tower: 
		- Each conseuqent tower costs more
		- Each tower cost the same but power is divided between all the towers
			(shooting speed, damage, etc, not range)
- Acquiring upgrades:
	- Dropped by monsters through the rounds 2/10
	- Purchased by merchant end of round     6/10
	- Purchased through shop whenver         3/10
- Augments/Items/Permanent Passive Effects:
	- Acquiring items:
		- Earned end of every few rounds     8/10
		- Bought from merchant end of round  4/10
	- Items have different bonuses           8/10
	  (example: gundpowder item makes bombs
	   more effective)
	- Are items and augments the same thing?
		- No:
			- Augments are stronger than items and unique (no stacking)   10/10
			- Augments are picked end of every few rounds                 10/10
			- Items are bought from merchant end of round                 10/10
		- Yes: 
			- Boring probably                                              2/10
- Shop:
	- End of every round. Contains passive items or upgrades to place on towers.  10/10
	- Separate slots for items and upgrades? that's for balancing
- Upgrades inventory
	- Size limit?                 0/10
	- Can sell to shop           10/10
	- Drag and drop on towers    10/10

So far:
	One tower type
	Towers are rarely acquired:
		- Paying in upgrades
		- Augments that give towers
		- Items that (maybe) give towers
	Upgrades come through shops end of round
	Upgrades may be dropped by enemies and placed in inventory
	Upgrades from inventory may be sold for gold
	Gold used for buying upgrades or buying new towers
	Each consequent tower costs more gold (TBD - balancing)
	End of round shop contains upgrades and items to buy
	Items are passive bonuses that are weaker and stack
	Items, augments, and upgrades should combo with each other
	Make different types of "archetypes" of items/augments/upgades 
		(i.e. explosive build, fast shoot build, spreadshot etc)
	Every few rounds, gain augment (strong, deck defining)
